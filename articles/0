\hello from jbs

jrobb blog script v0.3.0

jbs is a simplistic,fully hackable and customizable php blog script
<br>by Jon Robbins (based on <a href="http://www.cockos.com/hl--/">hl--</a>, which was based on <a href="http://badmofo.org/hlscript/">hlscript</a>)
<br>It is one of my main goals for blogs published by jbs to remain completely viewable in text-based browsers, like <a href="http://links.sourceforge.net/">links</a>.

this is <a href="?article=license">free software</a> : share, adapt, and enjoy!

<b>Article posting:</b>
[list]
  Articles are plain text files located within the articles/ directory. Articles are named only numbers (from 0 to ... infinity?), and are displayed up until the number contained in the file artile.top
  If a date is in the future, but the file number < the number in article.top, the file will not be displayed.
  This file is "0", to have another entry, I could make it "1" but to display that file I would have to increment the number in article.top to be "1"
  Additional articles can be created named thing other than numbers, and while they can be linked to, they will not appear in the blog list (ie. the <a href="?article=license">license</a>)
[/list]

<b>Article formatting</b><br>
[list]
  <li>Articles are just normal text files, and can be edited with nano, vim, or Geany--whatever kind of text editor you like to use. </li>
  <li>This is a key benefit of jbs, in that an admin can SSH into the server and just use nano or vim to create/edit posts</li>
  <li>The first line in a file is the dateline. This is where you will usually put the date, or some kind of marker. (See 'today' above.)</li>
  <li>\ at the beginning of a line denotes a topic. Each topic is boldfaced, and has a permalink generated for it automatically. </li>
  <li>"< !--more-- >" (without the spaces) designates a truncation for the main page, with a "read more" link</li>
  <li>Blank lines are automatically spaced out with < P ></li>
  <li>bracketed code tags to display html and other code</li>
  <li>see this file ("0") or the <a href="?article=1">next ("1")</a> for an example</li>
[/list]


<b>Files</b>
[list]
  <li>config.php The site-specific config. Edit this file!</li>
  <li>article.top This is a text file containing the filename number to make the top article. i.e. if articles/0 through 47 exist, this file should contain the string "47". You must update this when you create a new article and you want it to be the first displayed article. </li>
  <li>index.php the front page, with the bloggy-style article list.   </li>
  <li>rss.php Autogenerates an RSS feed for your site</li>
[/list]
     
<b>Tags:</b>
[list]
  <li>#Tags can be anywhere, like this</li>
  <li>Or you can lay them out at the end of a post (see below)</li>
  <li>All tags can be displayed in on the <a href="tags.php">Tags page</a></li>
