you need to copy config.default.php to config.php, and edit it.

then, do the following:

make a directory "articles/".
In articles/:
  if you want to use comments, make a directory "comments". chmod 777 it.
  if you want to use referer logging, make a directory "refers". chmod 777 it.
  if yo uwant to use a counter, make a file "counter.txt". chmod 666 it.
  make a new file called article.top, and put "0" in it.
  make a file named "0", and put the following text in it:
     November 11 2005 (or whatever the date is)
     \The Title Of My First Post
     and any other text you want

  Later posts will be 1, 2, and so on, and article.top should be updated
  accordingly. If the date is in the future, the article won't be visible
  until that time.
