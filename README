I wanted a simple blog for my website that was easy to maintain and could be updated easily over ssh.
hl-- was it, but it was lacking in features and had not been maintained for a few years, so I just started adding a few features.

This is the software that I use on my blog, and although I don't update it very often, I try to add new things from time to time.
