I wanted a simple blog for my website that was easy to maintain and could be updated easily over ssh.
hl-- was it, but it was lacking in features and had not been maintained for a few years, so I just started adding a few features.

This is the software that I use on my blog, and although I don't update it very often, I try to add new things from time to time.

BBcode type syntax is somewhat supported:
	[code][/code]
	[list][/list]
	[html][/html]

Here's a wordpress XML-to-html converter, written in PureBasic that I made to convert my posts to JBS:

I've since migrated my blog to Octopress ( http://octopress.org/ ), so I've started working on a script to migrate my old jbs posts into octopress type format.
The formats are very similar, so it is very straightforward:
